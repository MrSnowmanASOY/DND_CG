# DND CG
A character generator for dungeons and dragons

Was originally my first try at python and I was pretty happy with what I made. 
\
After a few years of it sitting stale I've decided I would work on it a little bit more.

To run the generator open printer.py in a python terminal

## Future plans:
More support for class dependent stats & abilities
\
More Support for race dependent stats & abilities
\
Class dependant saving throw modifiers
\
Support for characters of a level higher than 1
\
Rebalance or removal of character traits
\
Re-rolling ability scores if more than one is below 9
